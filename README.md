# YABE
YABE=やべ=Yet Another Blog Engine

Empty Project with only a rolling heart.

To force on my study and drag me away from the frontend which is actually not my favorite,

I have made a decided that this project will be paused for about 2 year (time when I finish my high school).

Minor modified will be push and when I'm bored with what I currently do, I will restart it for a minute.

Frontend is not the way I will go. Full-stack neither.

But I can confirm that this project must will definately have an end.
